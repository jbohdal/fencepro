/**
 * A change order filled in from what was changed on a signed quote (the quote
 * builder, after the lock refused the save).
 *
 * Each change is its own line, priced by the quote builder's own math
 * (quoteCalc, per run section rounding included) at today's costs: the signed
 * work is priced again today, then the changes are put on it one at a time
 * (style, footage, walk gates, double gates, tear out, the rest) and each
 * line is what that step moved the price. The lines add up to "the new work
 * today" minus "the signed work today", so a cost change since signing is
 * never billed to the customer. A price set by hand on the signed quote is
 * left out of these steps (it would make every step $0). Amounts are integer cents.
 *
 * A move or repair, or a login that sees prices only (the server prices
 * their quotes), gets the changes as lines and one price difference line:
 * today's price of the new version minus the signed price.
 *
 * Every amount is whole dollars (Jonathan, Oct 21 2026): each step is priced
 * to the whole dollar, even on a quote signed with cents, and the one price
 * difference line is rounded down to the whole dollar (a credit to the larger
 * whole dollar), so the cents never go on the customer.
